				It is possible to have a credit balance on the directors’ loan accounts. This will arise if the directors loan money to the company. It can also happen where the directors vote a bonus or dividend but do not take the cash out of the company, or on incorporation where the business owners transfer the value of goodwill to the company and leave it as a loan account owing to them.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="text-left" style="width: 9%;">3.15</td>
			<td style="width: 92%;">
				If the directors’ loan accounts become in credit (in other words the company is in a position of owing money to the directors), the company could pay interest to the directors. Consequently this strategy is ONLY available where (a) there is already a sufficiently large loan account, or (b) a loan account can be created.

			<td style="width: 92%;">

			<td class="text-left" style="width: 9%;">3.18</td>
