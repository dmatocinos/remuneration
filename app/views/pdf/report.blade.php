Do nothing
3.1 If you do nothing (i.e. you do not take the money out of the business) then based upon the company profits of £200,000 the company tax will be £40,000.
3.2 All of the remaining funds will be retained by the company so there will be no extra cash for the business owners.

Paying a bonus
3.3 Subject to a commitment being established before the company year end, a bonus can be voted before the accounts are finalised and is allowable as a deduction for corporation tax purposes provided that it is put through the payroll within 9 months of the company year end.
3.4 One of the advantages of a bonus is the cash flow. Depending on when the bonus is made available to the director, PAYE/NIC may not be payable until 9 months and 19 days after the company year end.
3.5 The bonus will be taxed on the recipients as extra salary and dealt with accordingly. 
3.6 The bonus can increase the maximum amount of pension contributions the directors can pay and get tax relief on. Generally, subject to certain restrictions, the higher the salary the higher the contributions qualifying for tax relief can be.
3.7 We would be delighted to help you implement this recommendation, and can provide a full service in the area mentioned.

Voting a dividend
3.8 Another way to extract funds is by way of a dividend. The timing and levels of dividend payments are set by the company directors, subject to meeting certain conditions. 
3.9 There is no tax payable by basic rate taxpayers on any dividends received, nor is there any tax relief or liability for the company if it pays a dividend.
