				The purpose of remuneration planning is to find the most tax efficient way of extracting money from a limited company.  It is a complex area of planning due to the way that various taxes interact	, it is also important to consider corporation tax, national insurance (employers, and employees), income tax and occasionally other taxes, such as inheritance tax consequences.

		<tr>
			<td class="text-left" style="width: 7%;">1.3</td>
			<td style="width: 93%;">
				There are two basic rules to remuneration planning:
	
					<p>i) start planning as soon as possible, and preferably before the end of the financial year,</p>
					
					<p>ii) ensure sufficient funds are left within the company to meet working capital needs and for investment in future growth.</p>

			<td style="width: 93%; border: 1px solid #992417;">
				As you can see from Section 2 of the report, if we look to take out {{ $amount_to_distribute }} from this yearâ€™s profits, <strong>significant tax savings of up to {{ round($highest_tax_savings) }}</strong> can be made against the most expensive strategy, which in this case is extracting profits by use of a Bonus.
